							<Paragraph>
								My avid interest in technology and its potential rests in my
								childhood. Having learned to switch on a computer when I was 2
								years old and spending hours marveling at the moving character
								sprite in Pok√©mon when I was 6, I can say that I have been
								surrounded by technology all my life. I believe that imagination
								and focus, in conjunction, can solve all of the world's
								problems. Comfort zones bore me and I tend to enjoy situations
								that force me to adapt and to learn. A self-proclaimed
								"learn-it-all".
